            <p class= "SectionParagraph">I recently got married in April 2019 to Naseem. I love finding time to spend with him. We absolutely love Forest Park and try to go there when we get the chance. If we aren't found there, we are probably at one of our go to restaurants: Sameems, Shu Feng, or Chef Ma's. We also enjoy lifting weights together at the gym or we can be found at home, watching Anime and smoking a hookah.</p>
